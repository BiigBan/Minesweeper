# Minesweeper
Malysh Vilatiy:
Malysh was responsible for the functional implementation of the board generation and mine generation. This included creating the data structures and algorithms required to generate a game board with a specified number of mines, as well as linking the game logic with the board and mine generation functions. Additionally, Malysh was responsible for ensuring that all code related to mines functioned correctly.

Gulchinko Daniil:
Gulchinko's primary responsibility was implementing the functional code for counting relevant places on the board. This includes the implementation of the game logic that determines which cells on the board are adjacent to mines, as well as which cells have already been flagged by the player. Additionally, Gulchinko was responsible for implementing the flag statement functionality, which allows players to mark cells they believe contain mines, and initializing the game itself.

Zaruba Denys:
Zaruba's primary responsibility was implementing the functional code for restarting the game, fixing any bugs that were identified, and refactoring the existing codebase. This includes working with the other team members to identify and resolve any issues that arise during the game's development. Additionally, Zaruba was responsible for creating a user-friendly design for the game, ensuring that it is easy to play and visually appealing.
